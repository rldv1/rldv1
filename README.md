# Hello there.

Reverse engineering is my thing - mostly mobile stuff, like obfuscation, anti-debug, RASP, and weird runtime tricks. 
Digging through protections, breaking things for fun (and learning ofc!)
**Currently looking for a job in this field.**
Im not very social, just like to work quietly and dig deep.

- I'm **17** (turning 18 soon ðŸŽ‚)  
- Based in ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±, open to relocation if needed  
- No formal work experience yet
---

## What i do:

- Mobile RE (Android/iOS)
- RASP libs (Promon Shield, DexGuard, custom stuff)
- Frida scripts, static+dynamic analysis, patching, tracing, etc.
- Low-level system behavior, DFU & BootROM (A11+) research

Some of the stuff i publish here is just ideas, small tools, research notes or experiments.  
I try to keep things clean and focused, without unnecessary noise.
